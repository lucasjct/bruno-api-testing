Demo how to test API using Bruno   

Bruno is an open-source alternative for API testing. We can use Bruno instead of Postman, Insomnia, etc.  

Using Bruno we can manage the requests, with facility, in separate files. There is one file for each request. In Postman, there is a unique JSON file for all tests. For example, if we change just the value of variables, we have that generate a new collection and replace the whole JSON file. Normally this is the process.   


Instead of, storing collections in the cloud, and should be necessary to create an account to use the toll, Bruno uses the file system locally and we can use the version control system and all team have access to API.
